# CastAnnouncer-WOTLKC
An updated version of CastAnnouncer for Wotlk classic

# ISSUES
You could get some error after an updated version or if you add some spells in the lua file. 
To avoid this you need to reset the addon with the game closed. 
Go into World of Warcraft_classic_\WTF\Account\numbers_account\SavedVariables And delete all CastAnnouncer files.
